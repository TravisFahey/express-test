#express-test
Express-Test:
This is a small express.js app that I created to test out using MongoDb.
The app utilizes mongodb-memory-server package to spin up an in memory MonboDb database and the app seeds some data to use for demonstration.
The app is uses a blog style format where GetAll and CreatePost endpoints are utilized.
